fbPictureFetch
==============

PHP cURL script used to fetch facebook friend's profile Picture and Cover in large scale ☺ 


This is the script I have made for fun, those who are intersted can use it!
what so ever fair warning  ☺
                              - siv
                


All the user's image details are fetched from the graph.facebook.com
these are in the form of json which is decoded to php array,
using the user defined file_get_contents_curl function we can
get the files and store it using the file_put_contents php lib function.
